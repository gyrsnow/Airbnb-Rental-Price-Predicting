# Airbnb-Rental-Price-Predicting

Kaggle competition on Airbnb New Listing Price Prediction (R)

# Overview
The inner-course project required us to compete with about 500 students from Columbia University. My model scored predicting accuracy RMSE 61.61 and compared to the default model accuracy increased by 54%.

## Description

People interested in renting an apartment or home, share information about themselves and their property on Airbnb. Those who end up renting the property share their experiences through reviews. The dataset describes property, host, and reviews for over 40,000 Airbnb rentals in New York along 90 variables.

## Goal

Construct a model using the dataset supplied and use it to predict the price of a set of Airbnb rentals included in scoringData.csv.

## Metric

Submissions will be evaluated based on RMSE (root mean squared error) (Wikipedia). Lower the RMSE, better the model.
